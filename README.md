The README should clearly explain the purpose of the website, technologies used, and instructions on how to view the website.

***README***
1.Purpose of the website:
This website is my personal site that I’m planning to build as part of my portfolio. It is also used for the submission of IAT 355 Assignment 1 – basic HTML+CSS and SVG visualizations.


2.Technologies used:
    a. Logo: A goose from "Untitled Goose Game" is trying to steal your key, but worry not, you have it under control, she’s going nowhere… for now. But Seriously, this logo/goose tracks mouse click positions and moves to where you click.

    b. Full-body animation: Every element except the visualizations on the visualization page is animated, so the content fades in and moves upwards when entering the page, with a slight delay.

    c. Hover effect for the nav buttons: The clickable buttons on the navigation menu have an animated underline effect when hovered over.

    d. Hover effect for the three circles on Visualization.html page: The opacity of the text changes from 50% to 100% when hovered over.

    e. On Visualization.html page: To the left of the three circles is the vis.js visualization. Three keywords—Psychology, Coding, and Design—are randomly generated and rendered.



3.Instructions on how to view the website:
    Step 1. For the index.html page, scroll down to view the full page. Use the navigation menu located at the top of the webpage to open linked pages (note** only the Visualization button is clickable; the About Me and Project pages are under construction). Hover over the Visualization button to open visualization.html.

    Step 2. On visualization.html, the three circles represent the interest level of the displayed topics. The larger the text size & circle size, the more I am interested in the topic. Hover over the cricle to see the interaction effect. To the right is the vis.js visualization.

    Step 3. You may click the Home button to return to the front page.
